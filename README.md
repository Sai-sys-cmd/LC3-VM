# LC-3 Virtual Machine  
This project is an implementation of an **LC-3 Virtual Machine (VM)** that executes LC-3 assembly programs. The LC-3 is a simple educational computer architecture designed to teach low-level computing concepts.  

## Features  
- Executes LC-3 assembly programs  
- Supports arithmetic, memory operations, branching, and system calls  
- Works on **Unix (Linux/macOS)** and **Windows**  
- Handles system calls and input buffering based on the platform

## Source  
I learned everything from this tutorial: [https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/#:trap-codes]. It was really helpful in understanding how the LC-3 VM works, and I basically followed it step by step to complete this project. I didnâ€™t come up with anything new for this; just built it based on the guide and made sure it worked. However, this is a stepping stone for me when I will be building something on my own.
